# Main-Project-1
First project for the UCLA coding bootcamp

This website was designed for people who are interested in exercising during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This website is using a "Google Maps API" for locating gyms near your location. This website also features filters for gyms to let the user know what gyms are currently operating during the COVID-19 Pandemic. It also has a "Weather API" to let the user know what the weather will be like since all the gyms are currently operating outside. As a bonus feature we added a "Twitter API" to each gym  with a live Twitter feed for each gym. For example the feed will only load live updates when the "Tweet has a hashtag and the gym (Ex. "The gym is so empty! #goldsgym") " in this example this Tweet will show up on the Golds gym area of the web page. This step will repeat for each gym.
