#  <h1>Main-Project-1</h1>
The first project for the UCLA coding Bootcamp
This website was designed for people who are interested in exercising during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This website is using a "Google Maps API" for locating gyms near your location. This website also features filters for gyms to let the user know what gyms are currently operating during the COVID-19 Pandemic. It also has a "Weather API" to let the user know what the weather will be like since all the gyms are currently operating outside. As a bonus feature, we added a "Twitter API" to each gym with a live Twitter feed for each gym. For example, the feed will only load live updates when the "Tweet has a hashtag and the gym (Ex. "The gym is so empty! #goldsgym") " in this example this Tweet will show up on the Golds gym area of the web page. This step will repeat for each gym. The main goal of this website is to promote fitness and health
